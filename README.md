# Colour Match

A simple colour matching game created in the Godot game engine.

## Installation

The only dependency is the Godot game engine itself, head to the [Godot downloads page to install it.](https://godotengine.org/download/)

Then simply clone this repo and open it up in Godot.

## Details

The game has two phases to each level, the first being a period
of time in which the game shows you a colour that you need to remember.

The second phase begins when you hold your mouse/finger down on
the screen and a rotation through the colour spectrum will begin.

When you believe you have the same colour on the screen as what you remember
from the first phase you release your finger/mouse from the screen.

A level score screen will show giving you an indicator to how close you were
to the original colour.
